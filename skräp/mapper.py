What is *MAP phase*?
The map or mapperâ€™s job is to process the input data. 
Generally the input data is in the form of file or directory and is stored in the Hadoop file system (HDFS).
The input file is passed to the mapper function line by line. 
The mapper processes the data and creates several small chunks of data.
